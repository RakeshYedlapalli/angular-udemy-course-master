	•	What specific data points or fields are essential for the calculations?
	6.	Are there any specific data validation rules or standards we need to follow?
	•	What are the criteria for ensuring data accuracy and completeness?
	7.	How do you currently handle data updates and changes?
	•	Is there a version control system in place for the data files?

User Interaction and Reporting

	8.	What are the expectations for the user interface of the new system?
	•	What features or functionalities are essential for users?
